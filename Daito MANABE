                Rhizomatiks Research, the firm's division dedicated to exploring new possibilities in the realms
                of technical and artistic expression with a focus on R&D-intensive projects. Specially-appointed 
                professor at Keio University SFC. Manabe's work in design, art, and entertainment takes a new approach
                to everyday materials and phenomenon. However, his end goal is not simply rich, high-definition 
                realism by recognizing and recombining these familiar elemental building blocks. Rather, his 
                practice is informed by careful observation to discover and elucidate the essential potentialities 
                inherent to the human body, data, programming, computers, and other phenomena, thus probing the 
                interrelationships and boundaries delineating the analog and digital, real and virtual. A prolific 
                collaborator, he has worked closely with a diverse roster of artists, including Ryuichi Sakamoto, 
                Bjork,OK GO, Nosaj Thing, Squarepusher, Andrea Battistoni, Mansai Nomura, Perfume and  sakanaction. 
                Further engagements include groundbreaking partnerships with the Jodrell Bank Center for Astrophysics 
                in Manchester, and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the world's largest particle 
                physics laboratory. He is the recipient of numerous awards for his multidisciplinary contributions to 
                advertising, design, and art. Notable recognitions include the Ars Electronica Distinction Award, Cannes
                 Lions International Festival of Creativity Titanium Grand Prix, D&AD Black Pencil, and the Japan Media 
                Arts Festival Grand Prize.Manabe is actively involved in the development and implementation of media 
                artist summits (notably,the Flying Tokyo lecture series) as well as other educational programs (media 
                art workshops for high school students, etc.) designed to cultivate the next generation of creators.

        Manabe is an innovator in data analysis and data visualization. Notable artist collaborations run the gamut from "Sensing 
        Streams" installation created with Ryuichi Sakamoto; performances of the ancient Japanese dance "Sanbaso" with prominent

        for a flagship commission and residency program in 2017 at the Jodrell Bank Center for Astrophysics, a national astronomy 
        and astrophysics research center housed at the University of Manchester. His close partnership with researchers and 
        scientists concretized in "Celestial Frequencies", a groundbreaking data-driven audiovisual work projected onto the 
        observatory itself.
